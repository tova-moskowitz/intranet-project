# This project uses the Material UI library for the following components:

- Card
- Buttons
- Search bar
- Dialog box
- Form field inputs

# Next steps:

- Validation for the form fields
- Icon to clear search field
- Make it a controlled form
- Close form dialog box on submit
- Error message when search returns no results
- Filter is now together with search- must build out filter separately
